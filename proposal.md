# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Speed reading web app

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A website that lets you speed read text by iterating through the text, showing one word at a time.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

My project will be a website with a text box. When a user enters text, the website will take that text, seperate the words, and show them to the user one by one at a certain speed. This can be toggled with a start and stop button. The logic behind this will be executed with Flask and JavaScript. 

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

N/A

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

N/A

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

- That the website can take some text that was entered and briefly show each word to the user, one by one.
- The user can adjust the speed of the speed reader (example: 200 words per minute)

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

- That the website can take some text that was entered and iterate through the text at a speed chosen by the user. 
- The speed reader can be toggled with a start and stop button.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

- A display on the website shows the user each word in a given text at a given speed.
- The speed reader can be toggled with a start and stop button.
- While the speed reader is running, the website also shows the estimated time to finish the iteration.
- While the speed reader is running, the user can go back and forth.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

To successfully make this web app, I'll need to learn JavaScript and Flask. I already know HTML but I'm not that familiar with CSS which means I have to learn how to use CSS and possibly a CSS framework. I need to come up with a basic framework for how I want my website to look. I also need to learn the details of how websites work. I need to research what speed reading is and how to correctly apply it to my project.
